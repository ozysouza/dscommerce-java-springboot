### Entity Overview

- **User**  
  Contains personal information and authentication credentials. A user can place multiple orders.

- **Order**  
  Represents a purchase made by a user. Contains a status (e.g., PAID, SHIPPED) and can have an associated payment.

- **OrderItem**  
  Represents an item within an order. Connects a product to the order with quantity and price.

- **Product**  
  Items available in the store. Each product can belong to one or more categories.

- **Category**  
  Used to classify products.

- **Payment**  
  Represents a payment related to a specific order.

- **OrderStatus (Enum)**  
  Values include:
  - `WAITING_PAYMENT`
  - `PAID`
  - `SHIPPED`
  - `DELIVERED`
  - `CANCELED`

## üîê Authentication

This API uses **JWT** for stateless authentication.

### How it works:

- Users authenticate via `/auth/login`
- A token is returned in the response
- Use this token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` for all secured endpoints
- Roles are used to restrict access (e.g., `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_CLIENT`)

## üîç Query Parameters
üìÑ Pagination Support
This API supports pagination for endpoints that return large lists (e.g., products, categories). It follows Spring Data‚Äôs standard pagination mechanism.

You can customize the paginated responses using the following query parameters:

## Parameter	Description	Example
- page	Page number (0-based index)	?page=0
- size	Number of items per page	?size=10
- sort	Sorting criteria in the format `asc	desc`
- You can chain multiple sort params	?sort=name,asc&sort=price,desc


## üöÄ Getting Started
